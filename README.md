# Commerce 365 for Magento
Public repository for Commerce 365 for Magento. Used for releases and issue tracking.

Click on 'Releases' on the right column, next to this text, to access all available releases. Make sure you download the right file according to the BC version you are running. For each major there is a release with a zip file that contains separate releases for each minor version. 

Version specific release notes are attached to each individual release, as well as an Excel file with all available events. 

Here on Github we only keep the last 2 releases per BC major version. For all previous release notes please see: https://nvision.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/folders/80000693419
